Programming Fundamentals Project

This is a very simple game I wrote after finishing my first course on programming, called "Programming Fundamentals" (late 2015).

It's based on the classic Snake! (2) game, and I could never turn the colored squares into images (whenever they did, the game had no movement).

Instructions: you are the cyan square and by default you move using WASD keys and change game speed using arrow keys. This config. can be swapped by pressing Esc key. The game is paused using Space key, and finishes whenever you reach certain (fixed) amout of points. Notice that at more speed you get more points and thus can end the game faster.
